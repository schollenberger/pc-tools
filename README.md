# pc-tools
Small programs that help me manage my PC

The tools are grouped by directories that correspond to tasks. I use different programming 
languages and they the tools may be expected to run either under Windows or within 
a Windows Linux bash shell (WinLinux).

These are the programming language that have to be supported to run all the programs, both
under Windows native and WinLinux.
 - Ruby
 - Python
 - shell scripting (mainly bash)
 - Go

Projects:
 - MediaWeb-Downloader (WinLinux) - Download content from Mediathek 
 - iCloudPhoto (Windows / WinLinux) - Compare iCloud photo directories

The Git repository is managed under WinLinux.
